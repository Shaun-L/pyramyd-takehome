Test Cases:
""CRM", Contact Management, Sales Automation" (Expected: Desktop Sales Office)
""CRM", Client Management, Invoice Management" (Expected: Solid Performers CRM)

I used empirical testing to find the best thresholds (having target vendors, and seeing what the returned similarity is)

Though process for Similarity Scoring Threshold balancing: High recall > High Precision. Ideally, we would strive for the perfect balance, but to cushion ourselves,
the recall being higher is fine since we want to be a decent amount of vendors to choose from when it comes to rating. Realistically, we are being
hindered by the small size of he current dataset. This threshold would most likely be shifted upwards in a larger dataset to account for more irrelevant data,
and therefore lowering the compute time.

tested it but avoiding the usage TF-IDF due to its lack of capturing in semantic meaning. 


To do:
- Need to test openai embeddings
-
